abstract = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) enable new services within Smart Cities. Efficient Waste Collection is considered a fundamental service for Smart Cities. Internet of Things (IoT) can be applied both in ITS and Smart cities forming an advanced platform for novel applications. Surveillance systems can be used as an assistive technology for high Quality of Service (QoS) in waste collection. Specifically, IoT components: (i) RFIDs, (ii) sensors, (iii) cameras, and (iv) actuators are incorporated into ITS and surveillance systems for efficient waste collection. In this paper we propose an advanced Decision Support System (DSS) for efficient waste collection in Smart Cities. The system incorporates a model for data sharing between truck drivers on real time in order to perform waste collection and dynamic route optimization. The system handles the case of ineffective waste collection in inaccessible areas within the Smart City. Surveillance cameras are incorporated for capturing the problematic areas and provide evidence to the authorities. The waste collection system aims to provide high quality of service to the citizens of a Smart City. {\&}copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {Urban access regulation turns out to be a strong instrument in shaping the fleet in urban zones and change user mobility behavior. A number of successful deployments prove it to be an effective tool in urban politics. The most important applications are Low Emission Zones, Urban Road User Charging and Park Pricing. However, a success is not guaranteed as many factors have to coincide that a zone regulation does not only achieve the desired aspect but is also accepted by the citizens. A structured approach with performance indicators is described in this paper, in which certain categories of the application are systematically questioned and turned into countable and measurable parameters. As a use case, the recently introduced Istanbul Smart Parking underwent an assessment "from outside" in order to demonstrate working with the performance indicators. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Technology is quickly revolutionizing our everyday lives, helping us to perform complex tasks. The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is getting more and more popular and is key to the development of Smart Cities. Among all the applications of IoT in the context of Smart Cities, real-time parking lot occupancy detection recently gained a lot of attention. Solutions based on computer vision yield good performance in terms of accuracy and are deployable on top of visual sensor networks. Since the problem of detecting vacant parking lots is usually distributed over multiple cameras, adhoc algorithms for content acquisition and transmission are to be devised. A traditional paradigm consists in acquiring and encoding images or videos and transmitting them to a central controller, which is responsible for analyzing such content. A novel paradigm, which moves part of the analysis to sensing devices, is quickly becoming popular. We propose a system for distributed parking lot occupancy detection based on the latter paradigm, showing that onboard analysis and transmission of simple features yield better performance with respect to the traditional paradigm in terms of the overall rate-energy-accuracy performance. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Delivery fleets ensure a steady flow of goods to shops. Especially in populous, urban areas, the necessary delivery and pickup activities rely on the availability of dedicated loading zones. Unlawful usage of such zones, e.g. for parking purposes, delays delivery of goods, disrupts traffic flow, causes additional traffic and endangers drivers and pedestrians The project i-Ladezone focuses on two major topics. The first is the development of management methods in order to open deliver opportunities for an efficient and effective monitoring of the occupancy of loading zones by loading vehicles and private cars, the second topic focuses on the development of a management system for keeping the loading zones at a maximum availability and reduce impacts on traffic by the loading processes. Also included is the development of an intelligent routing application for mobile use for the drivers of the goods suppliers. In the first project part, technologies and algorithms for an efficient and effective monitoring of loading zones will be developed and comparatively tested. As a result, smart units will be developed, which can easily be installed at the location of the zones and monitor the occupancy by vehicles and if they are authorized to do so. So loading zones for suppliers will be kept available and free for their use, the traffic flow would be improved and traffic jams due to parking in second line or else can be reduced. Furthermore, the behavior of road users will be evaluated (pre-/follow up investigation) before and after the monitoring systems installation. In the second project part an intelligent loading zone routing application will be developed for the first time. Within i-Ladezone the special routing system will implement the geographical position and the address of the loading zone itself as starting or destination point. The system delivers dynamically additional information of the loading zone application (e.g. occupancy, officially permitted loading times). With this real-time information at hand the system will be able to calculate the optimal route for delivery services at any time. The expected results will essentially contribute to an efficient, ecologically and intermodal delivery system within metropolitan areas. Last not least the possible integration in an overall traffic management system (→ "smart cities") will be investigated. i-ladezone acts as specialized sub-part of a kind of "sensor" monitoring special traffic zones as described, but also can extended to other zones to be monitored.},

abstract = {In this paper, we define the online localized resource allocation problem, especially relevant for modeling transportation applications. The problem modeling takes into account simultaneously the geographical location of consumers and resources together with their online nondeterministic appearance. We use urban parking management as an illustration of this problem. In fact, urban parking management is an online localized resource allocation problem, where the question is how to find an efficient allocation of parking spots to drivers, while they all have dynamic geographical positions and appear nondeterministically. We define this problem and propose a multiagent system to solve it. The objective of the system is to decrease, for private vehicles drivers, the parking spots search time. The drivers are organized in communities and share information about spots availability. We have defined two cooperative models and compared them: a fully cooperative model, where agents share all the available information, and a “coopetitive” model, where drivers do not share information about the spot that they have chosen. Results show the superiority of the first model.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that in places like New York City drivers often spend over 20 min looking for parking, contributing to as much as 30{\%} of the total traffic. In response, cities like San Francisco have deployed systems capable of pointing drivers to the closest available parking spot. Unfortunately, such systems have gained little traction as they rely on specialized infrastructure that is expensive to build and maintain. We present SmartPark, a smartphone based system that relaxes the requirement for specialized infrastructure by relying on the smartphone's sensors and ubiquitous Wi-Fi and cellular infrastructure. To accomplish this, SmartPark addresses two major challenges, under the constraint of minimum impact on battery life: automatic transportation mode detection and location matching. Solved together, they enable SmartPark to automatically detect when a user pulls out of a parking spot, making it available again. It addresses each challenge using a combination of thorough statistical analysis of the sensor readings and a novel Random Forest based classification algorithm. Experimental results from 12 volunteers, using 7 different smartphones, in 3 different cities show that SmartPark can distinguish 9 different transportation modes with accuracy between 95.57-100{\%}, enabling it to correctly detect unparking events virtually 100{\%} of the time. This is accomplished with a minimum impact on battery life-running SmartPark on a fully charged LG Google Nexus 5 for 5 h straight caused the battery level to drop only about 4{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recently, large sensor networks with several thousands of nodes are being deployed over large geographic areas in the context of smart city projects. In these settings, there is often a need to send a message to all sensors contained in one of multiple geographic regions, for example, to query for a free parking spot in several streets. We present Recursive Multi-region Geocasting (RMG), a novel multi-region geocast routing protocol which addresses the problem of delivering data from a source to multiple remote geocast regions in large-scale wireless sensor networks. The key idea is to treat a remote group of geocast regions as a point destination and forward data packets along a straight line towards the group, until a division point at which the group is divided, and the packet is forwarded towards the sub-groups in the same fashion. RMG is lightweight as no state has to be maintained at the nodes and the computations are simple. Simulation shows that our protocol achieves lower path length overhead and network relay load while incurring less computation overhead when compared to state-of-the-art protocols. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {A major challenge for modern cities is how to maximise the productivity and reliability of urban infrastructure, such as minimising road congestion by making better use of the limited car parking facilities that are available. To achieve this goal, there is growing interest in the capabilities of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), which enables a wide range of physical objects and environments to be monitored in fine detail by using low-cost, low-power sensing and communication technologies. While there has been growing interest in the IoT for smart cities, there have been few systematic studies that can demonstrate whether practical insights can be extracted from real-life IoT data using advanced data analytics techniques. In this work, we consider a smart car parking scenario based on real-time car parking information that has been collected and disseminated by the City of San Francisco. We investigate whether useful trends and patterns can be automatically extracted from this rich and complex data set. We demonstrate that by using automated clustering and anomaly detection techniques we can identify potentially interesting trends and events in the data. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first such analysis of the scope for clustering and anomaly detection on real-time car parking data in a major urban city.},

To provide the best network performance, the MAC protocol shall be adaptive enough in order to satisfy the traffic intensity and variation of parking sensors. In this paper, we study the heavy-tailed parking and vacant time models from SmartSantander, and then we apply the traffic model in the simulation with four different kinds of MAC protocols, that is, contention-based, schedulebased and two hybrid versions of them. The result shows that the packet interarrival time is no longer heavy-tailed while collecting a group of parking sensors, and then choosing an appropriate MAC protocol highly depends on the network configuration. Also, the information delay is bounded by traffic and MAC parameters which are important criteria while the timely message is required. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

To leverage digital information from each individual project into business value for the whole industry, researchers must borrow knowledge and solutions from computational fields, such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and Data Science. They will provide a guide to the development, and even transformation of current BIM processes, with potential for development of new tools and automation of many tasks. What is not entirely clear is if BIM could take advantage also from Big Data Analytics, as some professionals are been advocating. In this paper, the author analyzes Big Data problems and the BIM context, and argues that BIM could not immediately take advantage from Big Datainfrastructure. Nevertheless, a route of development is suggested, which extends BIM from its predominantly building-focused models to models that encompass an entire city, which certainly will demand Big Data Analytics. Thus, a new City Information Modeling seems to be the right path of development for BIM as it turns to be integrated with Geographic Information Systems and will lead to tools that would be adequate for future Smart Cities planning and management.},

With the aim to provide citizens with a better place to live, a new concept of city was born: the Smart City. This concept has gained much attention and many "regular" cities are taking action so as to become "smart". To do so, cities are deploying and using information and communication technologies, with the aim of tackling many local problems from local economy and transportation to quality of life and e-governance. In this article we recall the concept of smart city and its main areas of interest. We discuss that the ubiquitous use of information and communication technologies within the context of a smart city might lead to the transparent gathering of private data from citizens. We focus on the transportation area and, more specifically, on the parking problems that might arise in big cities. We propose a set of procedures, based on privacy enhancing technologies, that allow the private, secure and efficient management of parking in smart cities. The main goal of this article is to foster discussion about the privacy issues that might arise in a smart city and to provide an example scenario (i.e. public parking) to demonstrate some interesting ideas and show some open problems.},

A basic example of E-Government is shown in [8], where payment of parking tickets is done online using electronic means rather than physical ones. Local governments have been one of the major users of Geographic Information System (GIS) [4]. One of the uses of digital spatial information is the treatment of urban services and the finding of related solutions [12]. The transition between digital cities into smart cities needs 3D geospatial framework, including the integration of GIS, Global Position System (GPS) and Remote Sensing [4]. All of this information is provided to the citizens in services like websites or portals that offer mapping geospatial services [10]. Today humanity has a wide range of issues; to solve them we use information and different levels of knowledge. No matter what the issue is in real life, to solve a problem some kind of spatial information is used. Based on what was said before, people such us: directors, technicians, customers or just citizens need to know and manage this spatial information. But, why spatial data is special? Spatial is special because whit the advantage of technology all feature or phenomena could be represented by spatial location. Spatial data brings us measures of the feature you are looking for and gives this spatial reference of it. The term feature could be taken as service, location, place of interest, hot spot in different fields, markets influence, etc. In other words, we can represent the real world and the human activity with spatial information and show it on maps, charts or tables. All this knowledge of spatial data makes sense when decision makers or just citizens are able to use spatial information to get new knowledge and take better decisions; one example could something as simple as choosing the best route to get home, or something complex like the construction of a new route for public transportation in the down town. In order to better understand the facilities that GIS could offer it is necessary to know basic concepts of components and functions of GIS and the type and structure of spatial information. An important issue of spatial information is the existence of two types of formats that are widely spread: vectorial and raster data formats [1]. The first format is represented by vectors (points, lines and polygons); the second one is represented by pixels present in aerial photos and satellite images. Nowadays in general, the information depicted in maps is represented by a mixture of both formats. In this talk, we use open source software that allows to access and use spatial information; the software used for the practices are QGIS and GvSIG. This software could be downloaded for free from the Web because they have open source licenses. Finally, to understand concepts and management of spatial data some practices will be done by using one of the above applications mentioned. {\textcopyright} 2015 University of Fribourg.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a centralized electric vehicles (EVs) recharge scheduling system for parking lots using a realistic vehicular mobility/parking pattern focusing on individual parking lots. We consider two different types of EV based on their mobility/parking patterns: 1) regular EVs; and 2) irregular EVs. An extensive trace-based vehicular mobility model collected from the Canton of Zurich is used for the regular EVs, and a probabilistic pattern built on top of this trace is used for modeling the behavior of irregular EVs. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first EV charging scheduling study in the literature that takes into account a realistic vehicular mobility pattern focusing on individual parking lots. We compare the performance of our proposed system with two well-known basic scheduling mechanisms, first come first serve and earliest deadline first, with regard to two objective functions: 1) maximizing the total parking lot revenue; and 2) maximizing the total number of EVs fulfilling their requirements. Comparison results show that our proposed system outperforms well-known basic scheduling mechanisms with regards to both objectives. Parking lots managing the recharging of a high number of EVs will greatly benefit from using such recharge scheduling systems in the context of smart cities. {\textcopyright} 2010-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Commuters in modern smart cities need a wide variety of traveller information to be provided to them for taking the right decisions. Drivers need accurate traffic information on urban and suburban roads, parking and electric vehicle charging availability, weather information, dynamic toll rates, fuel prices and so on. Commuters on public transport require bus and train arrival times, traffic-based public transport travel times, public transport breakdown information and so on. Finally, with the growth of inter-modal travel within mega-cities, there is a need to also provide multimodal traveller services that integrate these and other relevant information to provide route options along with travel time estimation, estimated time of arrival and journey plans. Smart cities also have sensors (cameras, light sensors, noise sensors, etc.) deployed through the city to pick up additional data that can be fused to augment regular information and services. Such services and information would be provided over multiple media such as over radio, internet or mobile internet. On the other hand, smart cities can use the massive amounts of data collected within their systems to understand the city's mobility needs and to better plan and react. The data can be used in offline and real-time analyses for short-term and long-term prediction. In this paper, we present a unified traveller information platform for modern smart cities. We discuss the types of data that such a system handles and show how outputs are used within different systems. We discuss interactions with external systems and suggest how the platform can be extended by integrating feedback from client applications to better meet the needs of commuters and cities. Finally, we highlight the key challenges of developing and deploying such a platform and suggest some of the methods to meet these challenges.},

abstract = {The electric mobility business ecosystem (EMBE) is a typical innovation ecosystem. Participating companies can succeed only through (disruptive) innovation, and only through entering industrial fields which are either new as such or new to the participants. Consequently, on supply level, car manufacturers have teamed up with battery-, electric motor- and power electronics manufacturers, as well as with electricity utilities and charging infrastructure suppliers. On operational level, ICT services providers, charging providers and parking services providers have started collaboration. However, the integration of electric vehicles into smart grids and smart cities is slow, even if most desirable from an environmental point of view. Meanwhile, high procurement costs and a lack of range continue to cripple the growth of electric car sales. Thus, from a business point of view, the most urgent research questions are (1) what actually is the EMBE, which actors are involved already and which will be involved in the future; (2) what challenges keep the EMBE from growing; and (3) which scientific theories are at researchers' disposal for studying the various challenges? In this paper I sketch an initial EMBE and - based on a review of various organisation theories and frameworks - propose an initial agenda addressing research needs that may have been missed in the ongoing scientific discourse on electric mobility. In conclusion, organisation theory can be used to model the EMBE and also to study why disruptive innovations are needed and which mechanisms prevent them. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Moreover, there's no way to tell how this data will need to be processed since each application may require it to be available obeying specific processes. Thus, this paper describes the design and implementation of a platform that aims to integrate, process and make available data streams from heterogeneous sources.

abstract = {Smart parking is a typical IoT application that can benefit from advances in sensor, actuator and RFID technologies to provide many services to its users and parking owners of a smart city. This paper considers a smart parking infrastructure where sensors are laid down on the parking spots to detect car presence and RFID readers are embedded into parking gates to identify cars and help in the billing of the smart parking. Both types of devices are endowed with wired and wireless communication capabilities for reporting to a gateway where the situation recognition is performed. The sensor devices are tasked to play one of the three roles: (1) slave sensor nodes located on the parking spot to detect car presence/absence; (2) master nodes located at one of the edges of a parking lot to detect presence and collect the sensor readings from the slave nodes; and (3) repeater sensor nodes, also called “anchor” nodes, located strategically at specific locations in the parking lot to increase the coverage and connectivity of the wireless sensor network. While slave and master nodes are placed based on geographic constraints, the optimal placement of the relay/anchor sensor nodes in smart parking is an important parameter upon which the cost and effciency of the parking system depends. We formulate the optimal placement of sensors in smart parking as an integer linear programming multi-objective problem optimizing the sensor network engineering effciency in terms of coverage and lifetime maximization, as well as its economic gain in terms of the number of sensors deployed for a specific coverage and lifetime. We propose an exact solution to the node placement problem using single-step and two-step solutions implemented in the Mosel language based on the Xpress-MPsuite of libraries. Experimental results reveal the relative effciency of the single-step compared to the two-step model on different performance parameters. These results are consolidated by simulation results, which reveal that our solution outperforms a random placement in terms of both energy consumption, delay and throughput achieved by a smart parking network. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, in conjunction with the one of smart cities, is pursuing toward the concept of smart buildings, i.e., "intelligent" buildings able to receive data from a network of sensors and thus to adapt the environment. IoT sensors can monitor a wide range of environmental features such as the energy consumption inside a building at fine-grained level (e.g., for a specific wall-socket). Some smart buildings already deploy energy monitoring in order to optimize the energy use for good purposes (e.g., to save money, to reduce pollution). Unfortunately, such measurements raise a significant amount of privacy concerns. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of recognizing the pair laptop-user (i.e., a user using her own laptop) from the energy traces produced by her laptop. We design MTPlug, a framework that achieves this goal relying on supervised machine learning techniques as pattern recognition in multivariate time series. We present a comprehensive implementation of this system and run a thorough set of experiments. In particular, we collected data by monitoring the energy consumption of two groups of laptop users, some office employees and some intruders, for a total of 27 people. We show that our system is able to build an energy profile for a laptop user with accuracy above 80{\%}, in less than 3.5 hours of laptop usage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that assesses the feasibility of laptop users profiling relying uniquely on fine-grained energy traces collected using wall-socket smart meters. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {Nowadays, in big cities, parking management is a critical issue from both the driver's side and the city government's side. From the driver's side, how to find an available parking lot in a city is a considerable concern. As a result, smart parking systems recently have received great interest, both in academia and industry. From the city government's side, how to manage and distribute such a limited public parking resource efficiently to give every visitor a fair chance of finding an on-street parking lot is also a considerable concern. However, existing studies of smart parking management focus only on assisting the driver's side to find available parking spaces. This study aims to raise a new perspective on such smart parking management and to propose a novel location-centric IoT-cloud-based parking violation management system. The system is designed to assist authoritative officers in finding parking violations easily and recommends the least cost path for officers so that officers can achieve their highest productivity in finding parking violations and issuing parking tickets. Experimental results show that the system not only improves the productivity of officers in finding parking violations and issuing tickets, but also helps reduce the traveling cost of officers and to reduce the average violation period of violating cars considerably. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

A smart city system that combines mobile and machine-to-machine communications has been designed aiming to alleviate the above issue. The system uses sensors to acquire disabled parking spot availability information which is disseminated to registered users in real time. Utilising such information, users can drive directly towards spots currently available or even reserve one of them. Upon arrival, legitimate users are able to verify themselves through a simple text message, a special device or a smart phone application. User verification enables more efficient monitoring of these precious parking spots.},

However, advances in information communications technology have given birth to the concept of smart city, which is rapidly being applied to address some of the challenges being faced in such cities. This paper presents the development of an architecture based on smart city technology, for refuse disposal management in communities. A proof of concept prototype was implemented for the proposed architecture using Arduino UNO microcontroller board, proximity sensor, breadboard, refuse bin and a personal computer. The proximity sensor was interfaced with the Arduino board to capture dataset that correspond to the five different positions calibrated on a refuse bin. The dataset was shown to be of good quality since the graph of the mean voltages against the distances is similar to the proximity sensor characteristic graph. To determine the appropriate classifier for realizing the pattern classification unit of the prototype, an experiment was performed using the acquired dataset to train five different variants of the K-NN classifier. The 1-NN classifier was nominated for the prototype because it is simple and it gave higher values of accuracy, precision and recall.},

This is a complex task that requires the capture of the state and context of both users and environments through sensors dispersed across environments and users. It's the opportunities created by the emergence of technology that provide enough information to intelligent autonomous systems. Adapting expectations of a well-being assessment system to task and context is possible using the new techniques imported from different fields such as sensor networks, sensor fusion and machine learning. This article encompasses the design and implementation of a platform to evaluate well-being according to each context and translate it to sustainable indicators. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {The City of White Plains has a residential population of 57,000 people, which increases every day by 225,000 people who come in from the outlying suburbs to work and shop in the city. Due to the traffic created and the large number of spread-out parking locations, there is an urgent demand of creating an mobile app allowing drivers to find available parking spaces easily. However, the solution specifically focusing on this issue has been rarely investigated by the prior research. In this paper, we represent our case study of a smart city web application using semantic design for a governmental organization's parking app. The app navigates customers to parking structures in conjunction with their destination. The app's user interface was constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a tag-based network structure to facilitate exploratory behavior. The work culminated in a completed user interface, a report detailing its perceived benefits, and an evaluation of its application. Use cases are described for three applications - The Passport app currently employed by the City of White Plains, the app developed in this study, and a future app using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {A major challenge for modern cities is how to maximise the productivity and reliability of urban infrastructure, such as minimising road congestion by making better use of the limited car parking facilities that are available. To achieve this goal, there is growing interest in the capabilities of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), which enables a wide range of physical objects and environments to be monitored in fine detail by using low-cost, low-power sensing and communication technologies. While there has been growing interest in the IoT for smart cities, there have been few systematic studies that can demonstrate whether practical insights can be extracted from real-life IoT data using advanced data analytics techniques. In this work, we consider a smart car parking scenario based on real-time car parking information that has been collected and disseminated by the City of San Francisco. We investigate whether useful trends and patterns can be automatically extracted from this rich and complex data set. We demonstrate that by using automated clustering and anomaly detection techniques we can identify potentially interesting trends and events in the data. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first such analysis of the scope for clustering and anomaly detection on real-time car parking data in a major urban city. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The development of smart cities has been the epicentre of many researchers' efforts during the past decade. One of the key requirements for smart city networks is mobility and this is the reason stable, reliable and high-quality wireless communications are needed in order to connect people and devices. Most research efforts so far, have used different kinds of wireless and sensor networks, making interoperability rather difficult to accomplish in smart cities. One common solution proposed in the recent literature is the use of software defined networks (SDNs), in order to enhance interoperability among the various heterogeneous wireless networks. In addition, SDNs can take advantage of the data retrieved from available sensors and use them as part of the intelligent decision making process contacted during the resource allocation procedure. In this paper, we propose an architecture combining heterogeneous wireless networks with social networks using SDNs. Specifically, we exploit the information retrieved from location based social networks regarding users' locations and we attempt to predict areas that will be crowded by using specially-designed machine learning techniques. By recognizing possible crowded areas, we can provide mobile operators with recommendations about areas requiring datacell activation or deactivation.},

abstract = {Enabling a sustainable urban mobility is one of primary goals of the so-called Smart Cities vision, and the deployment of smart parking systems represents a key aspect. The proper operation of these systems heavily depends on their ability to automatically detect the presence of vehicles in the parking spaces. To date, this problem is solved by expensive wireless/wired systems. As the car presence is only one bit of information, with importance of knowing the ID of a slot, in this paper we consider the possibility of using Battery Assisted Passive (BAP) tags for those purposes. Specifically, the considered system uses a BAP tag, with the battery replaced by a solar cell. Once the light level is below some thresholds (ensured by car on top of it), the tag stops transmitting the data, and the system recognizes the slot as occupied. The feasibility of the proposed solution is experimentally verified, and first results are reported. {\textcopyright} 2015 University of Split, FESB.},

This work presents an homogeneous and suitable mechanism for global resource discovery, device access for deployed smart objects in different scenarios, and sensors and devices from end users (participative sensing). The integration of legacy and sensors already available from smart buildings and smart objects is presented. For this purpose, a resolution infrastructure called "digcovery" is defined for maximizing efficiency and sustainability of deployments. Digcovery architecture offers the framework to allow users to register/include their own sensors into a common infrastructure and access/discover the available resources through mobile digcovery.

abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are expected to play a crucial role in the sustainable development of new urban environments. The term Smart Cities has been coined to identify technology-intensive cities which provide the ability to gather, analyze, and distribute information so as to transform services offered to the citizens, improve operational efficiency, and entail better decisions at the municipal level. The future is today when it comes to Smart Cities. Numerous innovators and start-up companies develop commercially relevant successful products, and the Smart City is filled with success stories. The most well-known applications revolve around parking monitoring. Privacy is a main concern in Smart Cities: in smart grids, the system should be able to switch off some appliances to reduce their consumption so that it matches energy generation. However, this knowledge may have a negative impact on the privacy.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is today considered as one of the most important enabling technologies for developing a wide variety of smart services aimed at assisting the final user in the urban environment. In this chapter, we present how IoT can be employed to develop a system for the effective and efficient management of urban parking, thus providing a small, yet relevant contribution to the implementation of a real Smart City. Our system relies on the identification of each single parking slot but, unlike other approaches proposed in the last years, it does not require dedicated sensors and/or infrastructure, thus it can be regarded as a low-cost and low-effort solution. Indeed, it collects parking data from a mobile application on the drivers' mobile devices and possibly identifies each slot by QR codes deployed on the single parking spots. The amount of data collected by the system on parking occupancy allows inferring valuable information that can be used by local governments. For instance, it will be possible to define appropriate pricing schemes so as to promote parking areas not particularly occupied. The employment of an SOA design guarantees the integration of the developed system with other existing services within a Smart City. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract = {In the great majority of cities it is difficult and hardly expensive to create more parking spaces for vehicles since they have almost reached its full occupancy. Combining this problem with an inefficient use of parking spaces leads to congestions due to aggregation of parking seekers and regular drivers. Recent advances in low-cost, low-power embedded systems bring the opportunity to develop new applications to solve these problems. In particular, Smart Cities greatly enrich their sustainability by introducing new resource management applications that rely in those constrained devices a significant part of the functionality of the system. The proposed Smart Parking solution consists mainly in the on-site deployment of an IoT solution to monitor and signalize the state of availability of each single parking space, as well as using context information generated by the city and its citizens to provide accurate responses to driver's demands. Furthermore, this system improves the management of parking resources by public authorities, for instance handling groups of parking spaces facilitating the whole city traffic management. The integration of this deployment into an existing live test-bed implies an easy task requiring just the data collection through the available means of the parking spaces availability. At the present time there exist living test-beds which can be used to integrate these new functionalities for experimentation on IoT data level, to gain a better knowledge and understanding of the M2M world, reducing costs, resources, pollution and time. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

EVs are categorized in two groups based on their mobility patterns: Regular EVs and Irregular EVs. We use the data from an vehicular mobility trace collected from the Canton of Zurich for the regular EVs and a probabilistic pattern built on top of this Zurich trace aiming at modeling the behavior of irregular EVs. To the extend of our knowledge, this is the first EV charging scheduling study in the literature that utilizes a big-scale realistic vehicular mobility trace. The performance of the proposed system is compared with well-known routine unaware scheduling mechanisms (e.g., First Come First Serve) with regard to maximizing the parking lot revenue. Our results show that, our proposed system outperforms well-known routine unaware scheduling mechanisms and it is evident that real environments would benefit from using such parking lot management systems in Smart Cities. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to interconnect massive amount of heterogeneous, smart devices, with the goal of interweaving the virtual world with the physical world. Smart Cities are typical IoT application domains, comprising networks with large number of sensors that survey environmental data in order to provide different services, such as City Mobility solutions that facilitate on-street parking and traffic ow monitoring. Standards and specifications defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), like IPv6, the IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Net-works (6LoWPAN) adaptation layer, and the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) are cornerstones of the IoT. In this paper we carry out large-scale experimental evaluations in an IoT testbed of 251 nodes to analyze the performance of the IETF IoT protocol suite in such a large-scale network. We define a City Mobility Solution application, using traces from a commercial Smart City deployment and the commonly employed Contiki implementation of IETF IoT protocol suite. The results show that the out of the box Contiki IoT protocol stack is not capable of delivering a satisfying performance. However, after a thorough analysis of the initial results, a set of improved parameter configurations is derived that allows the network to achieve much higher performance. Among others, improvements of 60.39{\%} in PDR and 63.67{\%} in delay are achieved. Furthermore, the paper presents and discusses the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines for a specific City Mobility solution being developed by Urbiotica, a company with ample expertise in Smart City deployments. {\textcopyright} 2015 ACM.},

We present an algorithm that mines consumer behavior data only and applies machine learning to suggest actions for inhabitants to reduce the energy consumption of their homes. The system looks for frequent and periodic patterns in the event data provided by the digitalSTROM home automation system. These patterns are converted into association rules, prioritized and compared with the current behavior of the inhabitants. If the system detects opportunities to save energy without decreasing the comfort level, it sends a recommendation to the inhabitants. The system was implemented and deployed to a set of test homes. The test participants were able to rate the impact of the recommendations on their comfort. This feedback was used to adjust the system parameters and make it more accurate during a second test phase. The historical data set provided by digitalSTROM contained 33 homes with 3521 devices and over 4 million events. The system produced 160 recommendations on the first phase and 120 on the second phase. The ratio of useful recommendations was close to 10{\%}. We found out that a recommender system that uses an algorithm that mines patterns based on their confidence, independent of their frequency and periodicity, might achieve better results and a higher acceptance by users.},

This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation. Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (for example, Mitchell and Witten et al.). However, much of the “folk knowledge” that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate.

abstract = {In the urban city life, a human usually uses his/her owned user equipment (UE) to request services provided in smart cities. In order for UEs to communicate with the public service providers, the network traffic is generated in the cellular network (e.g. Long Term Evolution (LTE) network) and the Internet very frequently. And the returned results cannot be shared among UEs although they may request the same piece of information. With the information centric architecture applied to the LTE system, the LTE logical nodes can have the name-based routing, the in-network storage and processing capabilities. This paper proposes that by leveraging those capabilities, the LTE logical nodes can be delegated to provide close proximity services to UEs. The paper illustrates the proposed solutions by the use case of restaurant recommendation based on nearby parking availability. The proposed solutions provide collaborations and interactions between different public services in smart cities and significant decreasing in network traffic generated through the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and the Internet. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Connecting vehicles securely and reliably is pivotal to the implementation of next generation ITS applications of smart cities. With continuously growing security threats, vehicles could be exposed to a number of service attacks that could put their safety at stake. To address this concern, both US and European ITS standards have selected Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms to secure vehicular communications. However, there is still a lack of benchmarking studies on existing security standards in real-world settings. In this paper, we first analyze the security architecture of the ETSI ITS standard. We then implement the ECC based digital signature and encryption procedures using an experimental test-bed and conduct an extensive benchmark study to assess their performance which depends on factors such as payload size, processor speed and security levels. Using network simulation models, we further evaluate the impact of standard compliant security procedures in dense and realistic smart cities scenarios. Obtained results suggest that existing security solutions directly impact the achieved quality of service (QoS) and safety awareness of vehicular applications, in terms of increased packet inter-arrival delays, packet and cryptographic losses, and reduced safety awareness in safety applications. Finally, we summarize the insights gained from the simulation results and discuss open research challenges for efficient working of security in ITS applications of smart cities. {\&}copy; 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Background: Present day's car parking has become a major issue in urban areas with lack of parking facilities and increased amount of vehicles, due to this drivers who are searching for parking space they were roaming around the city in peak hours. This causes traffic, waste of time and money. Methods: To solve those problems, this prototype is developed using sensor circuit, RFID and IoT. RFID used here to detect the car details, IR sensor is used to find the presence of the car and all details are accessed from remotely through IoT. Findings: This system helps user to find parking space availability with the help of Internet of Things (IoT) technology by providing parking free space information. The IoT maintains the database of the parked vehicles through a shared server. So drivers can book the slots in advance and the parking information updated in server. In addition to the parking, theft management will be done i.e. a theft vehicle came for parking then the number plate is checked with theft list in the database, if it is in theft list then a message is sent to the police. Applications/Improvements: This prototype developed for the parking system with less human interaction, increases flexibility and security. This system is employable in airports and multiplexes parking.},

abstract = {Linear dynamical systems (LDS) are applied to model data from various domains-including physics, smart cities, medicine, biology, chemistry and social science-as stochastic dynamic process. Whenever the model dynamics are allowed to change over time, the number of parameters can easily exceed millions. Hence, an estimation of such time-variant dynamics on a relatively small-compared to the number of variables-training sample typically results in dense, overfitted models. Existing regularization techniques are not able to exploit the temporal structure in the model parameters. We investigate a combined reparametrization and regularization approach which is designed to detect redundancies in the dynamics in order to leverage a new level of sparsity. On the basis of ordinary linear dynamical systems, the new model, called ST-LDS, is derived and a proximal parameter optimization procedure is presented. Differences to l{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-regularization-based approaches are discussed and an evaluation on synthetic data is conducted. The results show, that the larger the considered system, the more sparsity can be achieved, compared to plain l{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-regularization. {\&}copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

As a case study, an urban parking application scenario is investigated and presented. In this scenario, smart citizens collect and share parking related events, such as leaving or occupying a free parking spot. These events can be presented on a real-time city map and used in navigation software, thereby helping others alleviate parking related issues, such as the time spent while cruising for parking. The simulation environment, implemented in Java, allows to investigate and assess the critical user base of crowd-sensing based smart city applications, and the requisites (benefits, challenges) of introducing such applications. Our simulation results show that considerable gain (approx. 15{\%}) can be achieved in the cruising time even with relatively low (30{\%}) user base in a medium size city (Novi Sad, Serbia). Moreover, the proposed simulation environment can be used also in real field measurements by replacing/extending input data from real users. {\textcopyright} 2015 BME.},

abstract = {A defective sidewalk inhibits the walkability of a street and may also cause safety accidents (slips, trips, and falls) for pedestrians. When a pedestrian walks along a sidewalk, his/her behaviors may vary according to the condition of the sidewalk—e.g., whether the surface is normal, holed, cracked, tilted, or sloped. As a result, the pedestrian's stability may also change according to the built environment's conditions. Accordingly, this paper examines the feasibility of using pedestrians' physical behaviors to detect defects in a sidewalk. Pedestrians' physical responses and paths over a sidewalk are collected using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor and a global positioning system (GPS). Then, after aggregating the pedestrians' bodily responses and locations, the irregularity of multiple pedestrians' responses are calculated in relation to their locations. The locations that show irregularities in the pedestrian-response patterns present a high correlation with the existence of a defect. The results of this study will help improve the continuous diagnosis of defects in sidewalks, thereby enhancing these built environment systems' serviceability.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to measure the impact that web services have on wireless sensor networks (WSN) when they are used for estimating the free size of parking places in smart cities. In particular, each wireless sensor mote (WSM) of these WSNs supports a fuzzy inference system (FIS)-based algorithm which predicts the aforementioned free sizes. Moreover, the inputs of this algorithm are the measurements acquired by the adjacent WSMs regarding the variation of magnetic fields caused by the chassis of vehicles. Well known web services technologies were used as the implementation vehicle for exchanging these measurements. Moreover, the well known network simulator 2 (NS-2) was used for acquiring simulation results concerning the energy consumption of the battery of the WSMs. These results have shown that Web services significantly increase the battery consumption. Furthermore, in order to model this consumption, a data fitting problem was solved and the cubic polynomial was fitted to the simulation data. This polynomial and the one obtained by modeling the error of the FIS were utilized in order to form a real-valued cost function. This function was minimized to get the optimal values for the distance between the WSMs and the sampling period based on which the output of the algorithm should be re-computed. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {During recent years, research in smart cities and internet of the things has acquired a notable relevance. Current research is mainly focused on wireless sensor networks and data analysis. However, it is still necessary to provide new solutions for social problems based on mobile intelligent devices connected to the city. Mobility is a key factor for social environments in smart cities in which humans wear intelligent devices that can also be installed in vehicles and continuously vary their positions in the city. Social computing envisions a new kind of computation where humans and machines collaborate to compute and resolve a social problem. The role of mobile intelligent actors in social computing is still a challenge and require new solutions. In this paper, we present a multi-agent architecture that incorporates a new mobile sensing agent model and virtual organizations of agents for information fusion and machine learning, as well as contextual information to enrich the social knowledge representation. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a work in progress, where we intend to investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and online Supervised Learning (SL) to achieve energy optimization in District-Heating (DH) systems. We believe RL is an ideal approach since this task falls under the control-optimization problem where RL has yielded optimal results in previous work. The magnitude and scale of a DH system complexity incurs the curse of dimensionalities and model, hereby making RL a good choice since it provides a solution for the problem. To assist RL even further with the curse of dimensionalities, we intend to investigate the use of SL to reduce the state space. To achieve this, we shall use historical data to generate a heat load sub-model for each home. We believe using the output of these sub-models as feedback to the RL algorithm could significantly reduce the complexity of the learning task. Also, it could reduce convergence time for the RL algorithm. The desired goal is to achieve a realtime application, which takes operational actions when it receives new direct feedback. However, considering the dynamics of DH system such as large time delay and dissipation in DH network due to various factors, we hope to investigate things such as the appropriate data sampling rate and new parameters / sensors that could improve knowledge about the state of the system, especially on the consumer side of the DH network.},

abstract = {Cities are steadily growing and the process of urbanisation is prevalent worldwide. With the aim to provide citizens with a better place to live, a new concept of city was born: the Smart City. This concept has gained much attention and many "regular" cities are taking action so as to become "smart". To do so, cities are deploying and using information and communication technologies, with the aim of tackling many local problems from local economy and transportation to quality of life and e-governance. In this article we recall the concept of smart city and its main areas of interest. We discuss that the ubiquitous use of information and communication technologies within the context of a smart city might lead to the transparent gathering of private data from citizens. We focus on the transportation area and, more specifically, on the parking problems that might arise in big cities. We propose a set of procedures, based on privacy enhancing technologies, that allow the private, secure and efficient management of parking in smart cities. The main goal of this article is to foster discussion about the privacy issues that might arise in a smart city and to provide an example scenario (i.e. public parking) to demonstrate some interesting ideas and show some open problems.},

abstract = {The rapid growth in the population density in urban cities demands that services and an infrastructure be provided to meet the needs of city inhabitants. Thus, there has been an increase in the request for embedded devices, such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones, leading to considerable business potential for the new era of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which all devices are capable of interconnecting and communicating with each other over the Internet. Thus, Internet technologies provide a way of integrating and sharing a common communication medium. With this knowledge, in this paper, we propose a combined IoT-based system for smart city development and urban planning using Big Data analytics. We propose a complete system consisting of various types of sensor deployment, including smart home sensors, vehicular networking, weather and water sensors, smart parking sensors, and surveillance objects. A four-tier architecture is proposed that includes 1) Bottom tier-1, which is responsible for IoT sources and data generation and collection, 2) Intermediate tier-1, which is responsible for all types of communication between, for instance, sensors, relays, base stations, and the Internet, 3) Intermediate tier 2, which is responsible for data management and processing using a Hadoop framework, and 4) Top tier, which is responsible for application and usage of the data analysis and the results generated. The system implementation consists of various steps that begin with data generation and move to collection, aggregation, filtration, classification, preprocessing, computing and decision making. The proposed system is implemented using Hadoop with Spark, voltDB, Storm or S4 for real time processing of the IoT data to generate results to establish the smart city. For urban planning or city future development, the offline historical data are analyzed with Hadoop using MapReduce programming. IoT datasets generated by smart homes, smart parking weather, pollution, and vehicle data sets are used for analysis and evaluation. This type of system with full functionality does not currently exist. Similarly, the results demonstrate that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient than existing systems. Moreover, system efficiency is measured in terms of throughput and processing time. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Short-term forecast models are generated using four supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree, Feed Forwards Neural Network (FFNN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Performance comparison among these ML methods was carried out. The effects of combining the internal and external factors influencing heat load at substations was studied.

In this work, we propose an innovative adaptive recommendation mechanism for smart parking.

Moreover we use cellular automata model mechanism for those parking spaces in the parking lot, it can adjust the situation that some parking lots are full and some are not. We also adopted the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm to build this two parts parking recommendation mechanism. Here the PCCC can compute with vehicle location information, nearest parking lot, parking lot status and the same or opposite driving direction. We take the driving direction into consideration can reduce road congestion and speed up finding a parking space from vehicles turning around. The current study evaluates the performance of the approach by conducting computer simulations.

abstract = {With the rapid increase in urban population and hence the automobiles, parking has emerged as a resource with fair amount of energy consumption, air pollution and traffic congestion in almost every major city around the globe. Therefore, its efficient management in terms of both energy and space is not only necessitated to save a lot of energy, but also plays a pivotal role to obtain environment friendly green cities. In this article, we proposed a smart energy efficient parking system, which integrates the image recognition techniques for license plate recognition, infrared sensor for group control and wireless sensor network (WSN) for intelligent light emitting diode (LED) lighting. The system offers better guidance to parking position, controls LED lights based on traffic distribution for maximum energy efficiency, and offers enhanced security as compared to its counterpart conventional system. The system is built on ZigBee based Wireless Mesh network (WMN) nodes equipped with image sensor and RF module. The vehicles in the parking lot are detected and recognized using the grid based algorithm and license plate image recognition. The concept of zoning or lighting group control algorithm is integrated with moving object tracking algorithm to control the array of lights to attain the maximum energy efficiency and reduced Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. In comparison to conventional parking and normal lighting, the proposed system presents the substantial amount of energy savings, less environmental pollution and enhanced surveillance. Moreover, the embedded advantage of improved reliability, reduced maintenance and low cost due to smart control suggests very satisfactory and optimistic results for future implementation of the system as an integrated part of smart cities. {\textcopyright} 2015 Global IT Research Institute (GiRI).},

abstract = {This work proposes an embedded system that opportunistically detects free on-street parking by using surveillance cameras. Intelligent boards are embedded in the cameras allowing a distributed processing and communication. The task of looking for free parking spaces demands a significant amount of drivers' time. This problem generally takes place in urban areas where there is a large number of vehicles and few available parking spaces (on-street or off-street). Decreasing the time spent in this task could reduce the traffic jam or, in an extreme perspective, alleviate the toxic gases emission or the fossil combustible consumption. Initially, it was evaluated three classical techniques for image processing applied to detect free on-street parking. The best one presents a success detection rate close to 100{\%}. After that, it was evaluated the performance of the embedded system by using only the best image processing technique. This performance evaluation considers three different scenarios: centralized, hybrid, and embedded. The last one is the main proposal and contribution. The results reveal that embedded proposal had an average requisition time of 2.10 s vs. 0.38 s of centralized one. The hybrid one presents the worst results. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Electronic toll collection transponders, e.g., E-ZPass, are a widely-used wireless technology. About 70{\%} to 89{\%} of the cars in US have these devices, and some states plan to make them mandatory. As wireless devices however, they lack a basic function: A MAC protocol that prevents collisions. Hence, today, they can be queried only with directional antennas in isolated spots. However, if one could interact with e-toll transponders anywhere in the city despite collisions, it would enable many smart applications. For example, the city can query the transponders to estimate the vehicle flow at every intersection. It can also localize the cars using their wireless signals, and detect those that run a redlight. The same infrastructure can also deliver smart streetparking, where a user parks anywhere on the street, the city localizes his car, and automatically charges his account. This paper presents Caraoke, a networked system for delivering smart services using e-toll transponders. Our design operates with existing unmodified transponders, allowing for applications that communicate with, localize, and count transponders, despite wireless collisions. To do so, Caraoke exploits the structure of the transponders' signal and its properties in the frequency domain. We built Caraoke reader into a small PCB that harvests solar energy and can be easily deployed on street lamps. We also evaluated Caraoke on four streets on our campus and demonstrated its capabilities. {\&}copy; 2015 ACM.},

The search for a parking place is a task which can waste a lot of time and affect the efficiency of economic activities, social interactions, and the health of the environment. The planners of transport and city traffic must pay close attention to this issue in order to achieve an efficient management of mobility in smart cities.

abstract = {This chapter explores a specific implementation of ideation-oriented crowdsourcing. In the follow-up of previous studies, we consider that ideation crowdsourcing does not necessarily mobilize highly skilled technical competences, but rather the ability of individuals to generate new ideas. Typical applications of ideation or creative crowdsourcing are artistic design activities. One can thus wonder about the role of creative crowdsourcing in the innovation process, upstream from the problem-solving steps. In this paper, we address this issue within a particular context: the evolution of an ecosystem based on an ICT platform. This chapter relies on a case study: Parkeon, a company specialized in the development and manufacture of multi-space parking meters, ran two crowdsourcing competitions in parallel, designed to uncover new ideas for services based on the use of multi-space meters. The case study highlights the convergence between certain conditions for the success of crowdsourcing and the factors contributing to the development of a BE: openness and modularity. Furthermore, it accentuates the role of users, who become the providers of new service concepts, and confirms the central role of the company leader for the development of the BE. Last, we discuss the not-invented-here (NIH) syndrome that can be encountered when crowdsourcing is implemented. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Based on new wireless sensor networks and the advent of battery-powered vehicles, this chapter describes three new systems that affect transportation in Smart Cities. First, a Smart Parking system which assigns and reserves an optimal parking space based on the driver's cost function, combining proximity to destination and parking cost. Second, a system to optimally allocate electric vehicles to charging stations and reserve spaces for them. Finally, we address the traffic light control problem by viewing the operation of an intersection as a stochastic hybrid system. Using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA), we derive on-line gradient estimates of a cost metric with respect to the controllable green and red cycle lengths and iteratively adjust light cycle lengths to improve (and possibly optimize) performance, as well as adapt to changing traffic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2015, IGI Global.

One of the reason is due to the lack of common view that can be used to investigate various smart city services across different domains. This paper proposes a domain-neutral execution model and an integrated life-cycle model of smart city services. We first identify essential activities for smart city services based on the city-as-a-state-machine concept. We then adopt goal-oriented thinking which clearly decomposes a goal and a means for each of the essential activities. By doing so, the proposed models can grasp essentials of any smart city service with domain-neutral activities and life cycles, while domain-specific parts can be varied by the means. Using the proposed models, we conduct a case study with smart car parking, where the proposed method compares the four different parking services. Finally, we develop ideas where and how the IoT and self-aware technologies can be applied effectively. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Given the amount of solutions offered and the maturity rate of application development it is not a matter of "if" but a matter of "when" in regards to these technologies becoming ubiquitous in control centers around the world.

Such deceptive action is a common precursor to nefarious, often malicious activity. A correlation coefficient characterization and machine learning methodology are proposed to detect and identify injection of spoofed data signals.

abstract = {Smart Cities rely on the use of ICTs for a more efficient and intelligent use of resources, whilst improving citizens' quality of life and reducing the environmental footprint. As far as the livability of cities is concerned, traffic is one of the most frequent and complex factors directly affecting citizens. Particularly, drivers in search of a vacant parking spot are a non-negligible source of atmospheric and acoustic pollution. Although some cities have installed sensor-based vacant parking spot detectors in some neighbourhoods, the cost of this approach makes it unfeasible at large scale. As an approach to implement a sustainable solution to the vacant parking spot detection problem in urban environments, this work advocates fusing the information from small-scale sensor-based detectors with that obtained from exploiting the widely-deployed video surveillance camera networks. In particular, this paper focuses on how video analytics can be exploited as a prior step towards Smart City solutions based on data fusion. Through a set of experiments carefully planned to replicate a real-world scenario, the vacant parking spot detection success rate of the proposed system is evaluated through a critical comparison of local and global visual features (either alone or fused at feature level) and different classifier systems applied to the task. Furthermore, the system is tested under setup scenarios of different complexities, and experimental results show that while local features are best when training with small amounts of highly accurate on-site data, they are outperformed by their global counterparts when training with more samples from an external vehicle database. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society of Information Fusion.},

abstract = {Parking space is becoming a serious problem due to the day-by-day increase in number of vehicles on the road. Particularly, in cities with large population, or in places where sports or artistic events are scheduled, looking for parking space is a major problem and finding a parking spot can be a frustrating experience. In order to combat this problem, some parking lots have introduced sensors to detect when a car enters or leaves a parking lot in order to track capacity and alert drivers if they are full. This is a partial solution that allows drivers to determine if a parking lot has open parking spots, but not the exact location of those spots. In this paper, we present a prototype of smart parking system using wireless sensor technology and networks. Using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), parking spot statuses (occupied or idle) are detected and transmitted to a database. This information then be accessed by users through website or mobile app (application) to receive real-time updates. This system should provide users with near instantaneous updates of available parking spots while the WSN allows for flexibility of sensor placement. With the successful implementation of smart parking, the economical and time costs associated with traffic jams, cost associated with wasted gas fuel, and time looking for an empty parking space that are caused by inefficient parking will be significant reduced. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {The availability of data trading mechanisms and platforms is a paramount prerequisite to the development of effective smart city services. In order for data to become a commodity ready for consumption, transformation and exploitation by smart services, it must be made available and tradable on data market places. For such data market places to be viable there is a compelling need for a sound data pricing model that is conducive of the healthiness of the market. In this paper, we discuss the definition of a pricing model in which views are priced and queries are valuated using views. We define the price of a query as the cheapest combination of the prices of a set of views that can answer the query. We discuss the devising of effective and efficient algorithms of the computation of the price of a query. We show that the problem of computing the price is similar but not identical to the problem of answering queries using views. We therefore adapt the MiniCon algorithm, which was designed to answer queries using views, to the task at hand. We finally discuss further challenges created by the definition of a framework for valuating queries using views. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {In order to apply machine learning classification algorithms, it is assumed that there exists a set of labeled data, called the training set, which is used to train the classifier. However, in real life, this training set may not contain enough labeled data to induce a good classifier. Recently, there has been much interest in a variant of this approach. This new approach, known as semi-supervised learning, assumes that, in addition to the labeled training data, there exists a second set of unlabeled data which is also available during training. One of the goals of semi-supervised learning is training classifiers when large amounts of unlabeled data are available together with a small amount of labeled data. The appeal of semi-supervised learning is due to the fact that in many real-world applications, such sets of unlabeled data are either readily available or inexpensive to collect compared to labeled data. Unlabeled data can often be collected by auto- mated means while labeled data requires human experts or other limited or expensive classification resources that may even be unfeasible in some cases. There are several ways in which unlabeled data can be used. In this work we explore one mechanism by which unlabeled data can be used to improve classification problems and propose a semi-supervised algorithm, called k-meanski, for using unlabeled data for supervised learning. There are two premises underlying the technique used by the proposed algorithm. The first is that input data falls naturally into clusters rather than being uniformly distributed across the entire input space. Furthermore, the initial input labeled data should fall near the center of the existing clusters in the input space. The second premise is that many of the points in some of these clusters belong to specific output categories. Obviously, the validity of these premises is dependent on the dataset used. The k-meanski algorithm works well when the data conform to both premises. If these assumptions are violated poor performance can result. Experiments using real world datasets where we randomly select a subset of the available data to act as labeled exemplars are shown.},

In this work, an investigation on the use of software agents negotiation to accommodate both user and vendor requirements on a parking space is carried out. It is shown that agent negotiation allows to assign parking spaces in an automatic and intelligent manner by taking into account that users have their own needs regarding parking location and price, while parking vendors have their own needs regarding efficient allocation of parking spaces, and city regulations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical technologies enable event-driven applications, which monitor in real-time the occurrence of certain inherently stochastic incidents. Those technologies are being widely deployed in cities around the world and one of their critical aspects is energy consumption, as they are mostly battery powered. The most representative examples of such applications today is smart parking. Since parking sensors are devoted to detect parking events in almost-real time, strategies like data aggregation are not well suited to optimize energy consumption. Furthermore, data compression is pointless, as events are essentially binary entities. Therefore, this paper introduces the concept of Lean Sensing, which enables the relaxation of sensing accuracy at the benefit of improved operational costs. To this end, this paper departs from the concept of instantaneous randomness and it explores the correlation structure that emerges from it in complex systems. Then, it examines the use of this system-wide aggregated contextual information to optimize power consumption, thus going in the opposite way; from the system-level representation to individual device power consumption. The discussed techniques include customizing the data acquisition to temporal correlations (i.e, to adapt sensor behavior to the expected activity) and inferring the system-state from incomplete information based on spatial correlations. These techniques are applied to real-world smart-parking application deployments, aiming to evaluate the impact that a number of system-level optimization strategies have on devices power consumption. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {A fuzzy rule-based and energy-efficient method for estimating the free size of parking places in smart cities is proposed. In particular, the estimation is the output value of a fuzzy inference system (FIS) which was implemented on each wireless sensor mote (WSM) of a wireless sensor network (WSN) placed in the ground below the parking places and it was observed that it requires 8.9 Kbytes and 5 Kbytes of flash program memory and RAM respectively. Moreover, the fuzzy rules were formulated by using real numerical data obtained from the WSN. Next, the well known network simulator 2 (NS-2) was used for acquiring simulation results concerning the energy consumption of the battery of the WSMs. In order to model the error of the output value of the FIS and the energy consumption of the battery, a data fitting problem was solved and the cubic polynomial was fitted to the real and simulation data. As a result, a real-valued cost function was formed which was minimized to get the optimal values for the distance between the WSMs and the sampling period based on which the output of the FIS should be re-computed. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Since the initial visions proposed in the SmartDust project fifteen years ago, Wireless Sensor Networks have seen a tremendous development, leading to the realization of the Internet of Things (IoT). Today, there is a large variety of hardware and software to choose from that is easy to set up and use. Even though there is an increasing number of real-world applications that employ large deployments of IoT devices, the wireless nature of communication in combination with the low-end capabilities of the devices raises security and privacy issues that have not been properly addressed. Considering also that sensor node brands are very different in their capabilities, providing a single solution is very challenging.In this paper we adopt Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) as an attractive alternative to conventional public key cryptography, such as RSA. ECC is an ideal candidate for implementation on constrained devices where the major computational resources, i.e., speed, memory are limited and low-power wireless communication protocols are employed. That is because it attains the same security levels with traditional cryptosystems using smaller parameter sizes. We provide a generic implementation of ECC that runs on different host operating systems, such as Contiki, TinyOS, iSenseOS, ScatterWeb and Arduino. Furthermore, it runs on smartphone platforms such as Android and iPhone and also any linux based systems (e.g., raspberryPi). Our implementation does not contain any platform-specific specializations, allowing a single implementation to run natively on heterogeneous networks.We look into the Smart Parking application domain and provide a solution that protects the privacy of the users by totally avoiding the exchange of confidential information. We also show how to protect a user's privacy by adapting the tool of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) with our ECC implementation. We study the performance of our system in an real-world outdoor IoT testbed and analyze the execution time and network overhead for each available hardware platform. Our code is available as open source software and can be used from developers who wish to achieve certain levels of security and privacy in their applications. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

We show that the application of a semi-supervised approach does not provide a significant increase in accuracy so as to justify its adoption due to its much higher computational cost, but that the application of a large-scale approach considerably reduces both training and testing time while keeping accuracy comparable to the standard supervised approach, making it a good choice for this class of application scenarios.},

Given the amount of solutions offered and the maturity rate of application development it is not a matter of "if" but a matter of "when" in regards to these technologies becoming ubiquitous in control centers around the world. While the benefits are numerous, the functionality of operator-level applications can easily be nullified by injection of deceptive data signals disguised as genuine measurements. Such deceptive action is a common precursor to nefarious, often malicious activity. A correlation coefficient characterization and machine learning methodology are proposed to detect and identify injection of spoofed data signals. The proposed method utilizes statistical relationships intrinsic to power system parameters, which are quantified and presented.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaping to a worldwide network of networks consisting of billions of interconnected heterogeneous sensor/actuator-equipped devices (denoted as “things” or “smart objects”), which are expected to exceed 50 billions by 2020. Smart objects, which will be pervasively deployed, are constrained devices with (i) limited processing power and available memory and (ii) limited communication capabilities, in terms of transmission rate and reliability. Future Smart-X applications, such as Smart Cities and Home Automation, will be fostered by the use of standard and interoperable IP-based communication protocols that smart objects are going to implement, by simplifying their development, integration, and deployment. Smart-X applications will significantly differ from traditional Internet services, in terms of: (i) the number of data sources; (ii) rate of information exchange; and, (iii) need for real-time processing. Because of these requirements, such services are denoted as “Big Stream” applications, in order to distinguish them from traditional Big Data applications. In this paper, we present an implementation of a novel Cloud architecture for Big Stream applications based on standard protocols and open-source components, which provides a scalable and efficient processing platform for IoT applications, designed to be open and extensible and to guarantee minimal latency between data generation and consumption. We also provide a performance evaluation based on experimentation in a real-world Smart Parking scenario, to assess the feasibility and scalability of the proposed architecture. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {Parking is becoming an expensive resource in almost any major city in the world, and its limited availability is a concurrent cause of urban traffic congestion, and air pollution. In old cities, the structure of the public parking space is rigidly organised and often in the form of on-street public parking spots. Unfortunately, these public parking spots cannot be reserved beforehand during the pre-trip phase, and that often lead to a detriment of the quality of urban mobility. Addressing the problem of managing public parking spots is therefore vital to obtain environmentally friendlier and healthier cities. Recent technological progresses in industrial automation, wireless network, sensor communication along with the widespread of high-range smart devices and new rules concerning financial transactions in mobile payment allow the definition of new intelligent frameworks that enable a convenient management of public parking in urban area, which could improve sustainable urban mobility. In such a scenario, the proposed intelligent parking assistant (IPA) architecture aims at overcoming current public parking management solutions. This study discusses the conceptual architecture of IPA and the first prototype-scale simulations of the system. {\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.},

abstract = {Recently, there are many researchers investigate about the recommendation system for improving the parking experience. In this work, we propose an innovative adaptive recommendation mechanism for smart parking. The cognitive RF module will transmit the vehicle location information and parking space requirement to parking congestion cloud center (PCCC) when the drivers need to find a parking space. Moreover we use cellular automata model mechanism for those parking spaces in the parking lot, it can adjust the situation that some parking lots are full and some are not. We also adopted the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm to build this two parts parking recommendation mechanism. Here the PCCC can compute with vehicle location information, nearest parking lot, parking lot status and the same or opposite driving direction. We take the driving direction into consideration can reduce road congestion and speed up finding a parking space from vehicles turning around. The current study evaluates the performance of the approach by conducting computer simulations. Simulation results the strengths of the proposed smart parking mechanism in terms of increased congestion avoiding and decrease parking space finding time. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Previous semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques usually assume unlabeled data are relevant to the target task. That is, they follow the same distribution as the targeted labeled data. In this paper, we address a different and very difficult scenario in SSL, where the unlabeled data may be a mixture of data relevant or irrelevant to the target binary classification task. In our framework, we do not require explicitly prior knowledge on the relatedness of the unla- beled data to the target data. In order to alleviate the effect of the irrelevant unlabeled data and utilize the implicit knowledge among all available data, we develop a novel maximum margin classifier, named the tri-class support vector machine (3C-SVM), to seek an inductive rule to separate the target binary classification task well while finding out the irrelevant data by-product. To attain this goal, we introduce a new min loss function, which can relieve the impact of the irrelevant data while relying more on the labeled data and the relevant unlabeled data. This loss function can therefore achieve the maximum entropy principle. The 3C-SVM can then generalize standard SVMs, Semi-supervised SVMs, and SVMs learned from the universum as its special cases. We further analyze the proper- ty of 3C-SVM on why the irrelevant data can help to improve the model performance. For implementation, we make relaxation and approximate the objective by the convex-concave procedure, which turns the original optimization from integral programming problem to a problem by just solving a finite number of quadratic program- ming problems. Empirical results are reported to demonstrate the advantages of our 3C-SVM model.},

This paper provides the scientific community with a comprehensive overview of the applications of a data processing platform designed to harness the potential of big data in the field of road transport policies in Europe. This platform relies on datasets of driving and mobility patterns collected by means of navigation systems. Two datasets from conventional fuel vehicles collected with on-board GPS systems have been used to perform an initial pilot study and develop its core algorithms. They consist of 4.5 million trips and parking events recorded by monitoring 28,000 vehicles over one month. The presented analyses address: (1) large-scale mobility statistics, (2) potential of electric vehicles in replacing conventional fuel vehicles and related modal shift, (3) energy demand coming from electric vehicles, (4) smart design of the recharge infrastructure and Vehicle-to-Grid, and (5) real-world driving and evaporative emissions assessment and mapping. The developed methodology and the presented outcomes demonstrate the potential of big data for policy assessment and better governance, focusing on the challenges and on the huge opportunities offered for future developments. This paper ultimately aims to show how big data can inspire smart policies together with public and private investments to enable the large scale deployment of the next generation of green vehicles, offering an unprecedented opportunity to shape policies for future mobility and smart cities. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.},

The system is able to detect vacant spaces and classify them by the type of vehicle that could park in that area. First of all, an approximate inverse perspective transformation is applied for 2D to 3D reconstruction of parking area. In addition, feature analysis based on Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradients (PHOG) is carried out on every parking zone within the parking area.

The source of variability among applications stems from (a) timing requirements, (b) rate and volume of data they interact with, and (c) behavior depending on whether they are stateful or stateless. These variations result in applications with different computation models. However, a smart city system can comprise multi-domain applications with different types and therefore computation models. As such, a key challenge that arises is that of integration; we require some mechanism to facilitate integration and interaction between applications that use different computation models. In this paper, we first identify computation models based on different application types. Second, we present a generic computation model and explain how it can map to previously identified computation models. Finally, we briefly describe how the generic computation model fits in our overall smart city platform architecture. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

From the simulation results, we highlight some limits induced by network density and occurrence frequency of event-driven applications.

abstract = {Classification trees have been successfully used in several application fields. However, continuous attributes cannot be used directly when building classification trees, but they must be first discretized with clustering techniques, which require some degree of subjectivity. We propose an approach to build classification trees that does not require the discretization of the continuous attributes. The approach is an extension of existing methods for building classification trees and is based on the information gain yielded by discrete and continuous attributes. Data from a software development case study are analyzed with both the proposed approach and C4.5 to show the approach's applicability and benefits over C4.5. Copyright 2002 ACM.},

abstract = {In 2008, the CEO of the company that manages and maintains the public bicycle service in Barcelona1 recognized that one may not expect to always find a place to leave the rented bike nearby their destination, similarly to the case when, driving a car, people may not find a parking lot2. In this work, we make predictions about the statuses of the stations of the public bicycle service in Barcelona. We show that it is feasible to correctly predict nearly half of the times when the stations are either completely full of bikes or completely empty, up to 2 days before they actually happen. That is, users might avoid stations at times when they could not return a bicycle that they have rented before, or when they would not find a bike to rent. To achieve that, we apply the Random Forest algorithm to classify the status of the stations and improve the lifetime of the models using publicly available data, such as information about the weather forecast. Finally, we expect that the results of the predictions can be used to improve the quality of the service and make it more reliable for the users. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {In the developed world, two distinct trends are emerging to shake-up the current dominance of privately-owned, combustion motor car transport. The first is the emergence of the electric powertrain for vehicles as an affordable and massmarketed means of transport. This carries with it the potential to address many of the immediate shortcomings of the current paradigm, especially CO2 emissions, air and noise pollution. The second is the rise of new hire models of car ownership - the concept of paying for the use of a car as and when you need it. This carries with it the potential to address many of the existing issues: outlay-induced car use, residential parking and social division. On a similar timescale, we are witnessing the rise of smart technologies and smart cities, concepts that use data about the state of a system or elements of it to create value. There have been relatively few examples of schemes that have combined the electric and hire-model concepts, despite the huge potential for synergy. Indeed, the majority is against them on both counts - cars are predominantly privately-owned and driven by internal combustion engines. Nevertheless, there is significant potential for this to change over the coming years. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Parking at James Madison University has been a challenge for years. With the increase of enrollment, this continues to be a more difficult problem. Currently at JMU, a few parking garages (e.g. Champions Drive Parking Deck {\&} Grace Street Parking Deck) have some capability of counting how many vehicles are entering or leaving the garage, but the technology has not been widely embraced across campus. JMU is in need of a smart system that allows a student/faculty/staff/visitor to know how many available parking spaces are in a particular lot at any given time. With this information, users are given a suggestion for a place to park. The JMU Secure Smart Parking via the Cloud Environment initiative aims to address this parking problem. Using a Radio-frequency identification scanner, our system is able to count the number of vehicles entering and leaving each parking lot on campus. The current decal that is provided to each vehicle will be replaced with a smart decal with an embedded tag inside of it. We also developed a secure, mobile-friendly web application and mobile apps (both on an iOS and Android platforms) that can inform the driver of the number of available spots in a desired parking lot. By harnessing the power of the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node) and cloud-based computing, the JMU community will gain a near real-time perspective of the parking situation on-campus. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

The detailed, dynamic data that can be collected from these devices provide the basis for new business and government applications in areas such as public safety, transport logistics and environmental management. There has been growing interest in the IoT for realising smart cities, in order to maximise the productivity and reliability of urban infrastructure, such as minimising road congestion and making better use of the limited car parking facilities. In this work, we consider two smart car parking scenarios based on real-time car parking information that has been collected and disseminated by the City of San Francisco, USA and the City of Melbourne, Australia. We present a prediction mechanism for the parking occupancy rate using three feature sets with selected parameters to illustrate the utility of these features. Furthermore, we analyse the relative strengths of different machine learning methods in using these features for prediction.},

Furthermore, the anomaly index we introduce combines novel metrics of obstacle irregularity computed based on the data captured by the Street Bump smartphone application.

Using GPS data collected from personal cellphones, this study analyzed mode classification methods for participants in Moscow, Idaho. Principal component analysis and semi-supervised Gaussian mixture models were implemented as major machine learning techniques applied in the classification task. For the study of two-mode classifiers, the prediction accuracy was found to be 65.71{\%} and 88.00{\%} for motorized and non-motorized trips, respectively. For the four-mode classifiers (bike, bus, drive, and walk), the model correctly predicted 66.67{\%} and 57.14{\%} of the trips for the Drive and Walk modes. The prediction accuracy for Bike and Bus was not as high due to the small number of trips observed in these two modes. Ultimately, the model built with PC scores performed better than model with non-transformed variables. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

We examine existing approaches to land valuation used in the UK, notably Trade Area Analysis, Spatial Interaction and Comparable Sales. We make the case that land use analysis, demographics and societal preferences affect the potential income and optimal use of parcels of land and hence the value of those parcels. This hypothesis leads to the introduction of a number of additional factors required to facilitate estimated land value, including traffic flow, population and site suitability. A number of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning spatial-temporal techniques are introduced to predict the value of all land parcels sold since 1995. We introduce a new technique, which includes (i) the application of Support Vector Machines to land use analysis; (ii) the use of predictive techniques for macro-environmental factors; (iii) the use of large, open-source data sets to improve valuation; (iv) industry alignment in predefined industrial tool. A number of different mathematical techniques are used to validate the proposed model and we show that our model demonstrates 92{\%} accuracy for residential pricing predictions. {\&}copy; 2015 ACM.},

So far, the appeared solutions were centered around the notion of free parking spots. This approach does not take into account the dynamics of the traffic and the drivers outside of the system.

In this work, we first describe the S2-Move architecture, all the actors involved in the urban scenario, the communication among devices and the core platform, and a set of mobility services that will be used as a proof of the potentialities of the proposed approach. Then, considering both architecture and the considered mobility services, we discuss the main issues related to trustiness and security we should taken into account in the design of a secure and trusted S2-Move architecture. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

abstract = {The recent availability of datasets on transportation networks with higher spatial and temporal resolution is enabling new research activities in the fields of Territorial Intelligence and Smart Cities. Among these, many research efforts are aimed at predicting traffic congestions to alleviate their negative effects on society, mainly by learning recurring mobility patterns. Within this field, in this paper we propose an integrated solution to predict and visualize non-recurring traffic congestion in urban environments caused by Planned Special Events (PSE), such as a soccer game or a concert. Predictions are done by means of two Machine Learning-based techniques. These have been proven to successfully outperform current state of the art predictions by 35{\%} in an empirical assessment we conducted over a time frame of 7 months within the inner city of Cologne, Germany. The predicted congestions are fed into a specifically conceived visualization tool we designed to allow Decision Makers to evaluate the situation and take actions to improve mobility.},

abstract = {Poor traffic management in urban environments is responsible for congestion, unnecessary fuel consumption and pollution. Based on new wireless sensor networks and the advent of battery-powered vehicles, this chapter describes three new systems that affect transportation in Smart Cities. First, a Smart Parking system which assigns and reserves an optimal parking space based on the driver's cost function, combining proximity to destination and parking cost. Second, a system to optimally allocate electric vehicles to charging stations and reserve spaces for them. Finally, we address the traffic light control problem by viewing the operation of an intersection as a stochastic hybrid system. Using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA), we derive on-line gradient estimates of a cost metric with respect to the controllable green and red cycle lengths and iteratively adjust light cycle lengths to improve (and possibly optimize) performance, as well as adapt to changing traffic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2016 by IGI Global.

abstract = {The quality of point clouds obtained by RGB-D camera-based indoor mobile mapping can be limited by local degradation because of complex scenarios such as sensor characteristics, partial occlusions, cluttered backgrounds, and complex illumination conditions. This paper presents a machine learning framework to assess the local quality of indoor mobile mapping point cloud data. In our proposed framework, a point cloud dataset with multiple kinds of quality problems is first created by manual annotation and degradation simulation. Then, feature extraction methods based on 3D patches are treated as operating units to conduct quality assessment in local regions. Also, a feature selection algorithm is deployed to obtain the essential components of feature sets that are used to effectively represent local degradation. Finally, a semi-supervised method is introduced to classify quality types of point clouds. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework obtained promising quality assessment results with limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) enables Smart Cities with novel services. Waste collection in Smart Cities becomes a dynamic process with the proliferation of sensors and actuators embedded on real waste bins. Heterogeneous fleets of trucks are used for efficient waste collection exploiting the diverse road network. In this paper we propose a novel approach by incorporating Low Capacity Trucks (LCTs) and High Capacity Trucks (HCTs). However, HCTs are serving as Mobile Depots (MDs) which are cost efficient and decongest traffic in Smart Cities. A detailed system overview illustrates the architecture of the proposed approach. We also propose novel algorithms which support dynamic waste collection with MDs. Scheduling and routing are transformed to dynamic models. Specifically, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm while we customize an existing routing algorithm. The models where experimentally evaluated with real and synthetic data from the city of St. Petersburg, Russia. The results were promising and proved that the incorporation of MDs is efficient for waste collection in IoT-enabled Smart Cities. Finally, we perform an economic analysis in order to define the economic impact of the proposed solution to the municipality budget for an ownership cost for a period of five years; in which the proposed solution proved to be cost efficient. {\&}copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {The growth in low-cost, low-power sensing and communication technologies is creating a pervasive network infrastructure called the Internet of Things (IoT), which enables a wide range of physical objects and environments to be monitored in fine spatial and temporal detail. The detailed, dynamic data that can be collected from these devices provide the basis for new business and government applications in areas such as public safety, transport logistics and environmental management. There has been growing interest in the IoT for realising smart cities, in order to maximise the productivity and reliability of urban infrastructure, such as minimising road congestion and making better use of the limited car parking facilities. In this work, we consider two smart car parking scenarios based on real-time car parking information that has been collected and disseminated by the City of San Francisco, USA and the City of Melbourne, Australia. We present a prediction mechanism for the parking occupancy rate using three feature sets with selected parameters to illustrate the utility of these features. Furthermore, we analyse the relative strengths of different machine learning methods in using these features for prediction. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {A methodological framework for multiple steps ahead parking availability prediction is presented. Two different types of predictions are provided: the probability of a free space to continue being free in subsequent time intervals, and the short-term parking occupancy prediction in selected regions of an urban road network. The available data come from a wide network of on-street parking sensors in the "smart" city of Santander, Spain. The sensor network is segmented in four different regions, and then survival and neural network models are developed for each region separately. Findings show that the Weibull parametric models best describe the probability of a parking space to continue to be free in the forthcoming time intervals. Moreover, simple genetically optimized multilayer perceptrons accurately predict region parking occupancy rates up to 30 minutes in the future by exploiting 1-minute data. Finally, the real time, Web-based, implementation of the proposed parking prediction availability system is presented. {\textcopyright} 2016 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Smart cities are usually defined as modern cities with smooth information processes, facilitation mechanisms for creativity and innovativeness, and smart and sustainable solutions promoted through service platforms. With the objective of improving citizen's quality of life and quickly and efficiently make informed decisions, authorities try to monitor all information of city systems. Smart cities provide the integration of all systems in the city via a centralized command centre, which provides a holistic view of it. As smart cities emerge, old systems already in place are trying to evolve to become smarter, although these systems have many specific needs that need to be attended. With the intent to suit the needs of specific systems the focus of this work is to gather viable information that leads to analyse and, present solutions to address their current shortcomings. In order to understand the most scalable, adaptable and interoperable architecture for the problem, existing architectures will be analysed as well as the algorithms that make them work. To this end, we propose a new architecture to smart cities. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications.},
